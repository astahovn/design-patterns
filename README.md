## PHP design patterns practice

I try to apply the knowledge of design patterns in the trading procedures subject area.
 
## A little about the subject

Trading procedure is a tool to choose a winner between goods suppliers.

As an example, we need to buy a computer with a lower price and a better features.
What can we do? We can make a trading procedure such as a tender. 
There is we specify a start price and a list of features. And then we publish this trading procedure.
Potential suppliers can view it and send their applications to us.
After that we can select the best application, sign contract with the winner supplier and get the computer of our dream.

## Installation
You should install dependencies with `Composer`:

```bash
$ composer install
```

Read more about how to install and use `Composer` on your local machine [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

## Tests
To run tests use:

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
