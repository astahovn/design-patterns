Strategy
========

Winner supplier has to pay a fee to our trading service. 
But before the trading procedure takes place we do not know who will be a winner.
So that we need to block fee sum on a suppliers deposits before the trading begin.

We have some strategies of how to block deposits:
*   free participation (may be a promotion or a discount)
*   standard fee
*   serious fee (for trading procedures with a high price)
